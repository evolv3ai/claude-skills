  "description": "Production-ready authentication framework for TypeScript with Cloudflare D1 support via Drizzle ORM or Kysely. CRITICAL: better-auth requires Drizzle ORM or Kysely as adapters - there is NO direct d1Adapter. Use this skill when building auth systems as self-hosted alternative to Clerk or Auth.js for Cloudflare Workers. Supports social providers, email/password, magic links, 2FA, passkeys, organizations, RBAC. Prevents 12+ errors including D1 adapter misconfiguration, schema generation issues, session serialization, CORS, OAuth flows.",
